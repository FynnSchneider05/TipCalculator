## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.


## The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Calculate the correct tip and total cost of the bill per person

**ScreenShot of my project/design**

**1) Home Page where a user can enter a bill, the percentage they want to tip and the amount of persons. The page will calculate how much each person has to pay**
